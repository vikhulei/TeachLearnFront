LESSON 2
A shop assistant starts their day early in the morning. They arrive at the shop before it opens to prepare everything. When the shop opens, the assistant greets customers with a smile. They help people find what they need and answer their questions. In the afternoon, they may take a short lunch break. At the end of the day, they clean up, count the money, and lock the doors before going home.
